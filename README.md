To start the Rebuff.ai project and test the tracing functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running the following commands in the project's root directory:

   For Python dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For JavaScript dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Jaeger Tracing Server: Start the Jaeger tracing server by running the following command:

   ```shell
   docker run -d -p 6831:6831/udp -p 16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
   ```

   This command starts the Jaeger server in a Docker container and exposes ports 6831 for UDP and 16686 for the Jaeger UI.

3. Update Configuration: Update the configuration files with the appropriate addresses and ports for the Jaeger server and Google Cloud Trace. This includes updating the following files:

   - For Python SDK: `python_sdk/sdk.py` (Replace the `agent_host_name` and `agent_port` values in the `JaegerSpanExporter` with the appropriate Jaeger server address and port.)

   - For JavaScript SDK: `js_sdk/index.js` (Replace the `endpoint` value in the `JaegerExporter` with the appropriate Jaeger server address.)

4. Run Tests: Run the tests to verify the tracing functionality. Execute the following commands in the project's root directory:

   For Python SDK Test:

   ```shell
   python -m unittest src/tests/python_sdk_test.py
   ```

   For JavaScript SDK Test:

   ```shell
   npm test
   ```

   These commands will execute the test files and check if the traces are correctly sent to the Jaeger backend.

5. Start the Node.js Server: Start the Node.js server by running the following command in the project's root directory:

   ```shell
   node src/server/app.js
   ```

   This command starts the server and initializes the tracing functionality.
